# 2D-platformer

This is my very first digital game project. It was 2D platformer based on Dante's Inferno. This was my little baby because it's one of my favorite books and ideas that I love to play with.

This is, probably, not the best project to show in my portfolio, but I wanted to show what I have reached in game development in less than a year (we have started this project in October and had 4 weeks to complete it). During this time we have managed to complete the third level of hell.

During this project I have been a team lead and a lead programmer (there was two of us overall). I have worked mostly on player movement and health, itâ€™s animations and movement, enemies and NPCs animations and movement, floating numbers after the player dealt damage and score manager. Also me and lead artist worked on lore and level design. We have had a whole story behind it, why you are in hell, we thought of cinematics that we could have and a possible ending of the game as well as a list of bosses that would be on each level. Basically, we made the whole game in our minds : D

For this project I have also done some 2D assets (by the way, it was a pixel game).
