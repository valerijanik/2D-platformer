# 2D-platformer

This is my very first digital game project. It was 2D platformer based on Dante's Inferno. This was my little baby because it's one of my favourite books and ideas that I love to play with.

This is, probably, not the best project to show in my portfolio, but I wanted to show what I have reached in game development in less than a year (we have started this project in October and had 4 weeks to complete it).
